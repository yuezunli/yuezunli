## Hi there üëã
I am an Assistant Professor/Lecturer in the Institute of Artificial Intelligence, at Ocean University of China. 

My research interest lies at multimedia forensics, computer vision, and vision security. I have published more than 30 papers in top conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, ICCV, CVPR, ECCV, TIFS, TCSVT, and PR, with over **6,900** citations on Google Scholar, including several papers with more than **1,000** citations each (CVPR20, CVPRW19, ICASSP19, WIFS18). The WIFS18 paper was also featured on [CCTV13‚Äôs "World Weekly" special on deepfakes](https://tv.cctv.com/2019/04/28/VIDE0aLKiWV83f2PrbZDF4G0190428.shtml) [7:43]. I have been recognized on Stanford‚Äôs 2024 list of the top 2% of scientists worldwide and am a recipient of the 2024 ACM Qingdao Rising Star Award.

I was a Senior Research Scientist at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University at Buffalo, SUNY, working with [Siwei Lyu](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~siweilyu/lyu_lab.html). I was a summer intern at GE glocal research center during 2016 - 2018. I received Ph.D. degree in computer science at University at Albany, SUNY in 2020, advised by [Siwei Lyu (IEEE/IAPR Fellow)](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~siweilyu/lyu_lab.html). I received M.S. degree in Computer Science in 2015 and B.S. degree in Software Engineering in 2012 at Shandong University.

üè¢ Currently, I am leading [Vision Analysis and Security (VAS) lab](https://yuezunli.github.io/ligroup/) <img src="https://yuezunli.github.io/images/logo.png" width="25">. Please drop me an email if you are interested in an internship / M.S. program.
